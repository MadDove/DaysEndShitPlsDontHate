description=This is a mod I have put up for NoMiS's Youtube channel. It consists mainly of Tailoring, Carpentry, Medical, and other handy survival recipes, which in my opinion should be in game. It would be a relatively clean mod you can add to any current save files since I only use vanilla items to create already excisting items that are otherwise without a proper recipe. (much like building a bridge in between two existing landmarks). I have tried to make sense of the materials used and the outcome, I have also added skill requirements for the majority of them. Hopefully you guys enjoy this little mod! :)
