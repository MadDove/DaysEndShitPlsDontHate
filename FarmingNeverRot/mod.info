description=After plants fully mature they will not rot. Resets the max growth cycle if the plant is fully mature when checked. I hate the idea of farming in multiplayer when crops go bad because you didn't log in for a day. Feeling stuck at a your safe house waiting for pixels to grow, no more! 2021122200
